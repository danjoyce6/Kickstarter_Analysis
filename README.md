# Kickstarting with Excel ---
## Overview of Project --- 
The Kickstarter data set contains data on various types of kickstarter projects in televesion, media, science, and theater to name a few.  The dataset contains metrics on funding goals, amount of money raised, start dates, and other variables that can determine the success of the kickstarter project.  The kickstarter dataset provided information and data for analysis on theater kickstarter projects between 2010-2017.   The dataset was used to evaluate how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals to aid a client, Louise, in analyzing her current play *Fever*.  The clients play has already come close to its fundraising goal and the data set was used to evaluate Outcomes Based on Launch Dates and Outcomes based on Goal amounts to analyze the current status of her own play.  
### Purpose ---
The purpose of this data analysis was to utilize the excel dataset Kickstarter to create a visualization of outcomes of plays based on their launch date and goal amounts to present to Louise on kickstarter projects that are similar to her own, *Fever*.  
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date ---
The variables of Parent Category, Years, and Outcomes in the Kickstarter dataset were all used to make a line graph depicting Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date. As seen in Figure 1 ,Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date, the most "Successful" theater kickstarter projects based on launch date occurred in May.  The summer months of April ,May, June, July, and August presented the largest amount of "Successful" outcomes for theater based kickstarter projects.  The most "Failed" projects occurred in October, but remained relatively constant throughout the remained of months.  The time of start date did not appear to have an effect on whether or not a kickstarter is "Canceled".  Please, refer to Figure 1 below, Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date. ---

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals ---
The "Goal" variable was stratified into categories and then the number of "Successful", "Failed", and "Canceled" plays were determined based on the stratified goal amounts.  The percentage success and percentage failed were then determined based on the total projects within each stratified amount of "Goals".  Based on the analysis and Figure 2 - Outcomes Based on Goal, the most "Successful" plays were those that had a goal amount of less than 1000 dollars.  Increasing the goal amount after the less than 1000 goal amount was inversely related with the percent of "Successful" plays until the goal amount reached the 35000-45000 dollar range.  Increasing the goal amount was directly related to the percentage of "Failed" proejcts.  The percent of "Failed" projects also decreased in the 35000 to 45000 goal range. ---

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered ---
The data presented does provide some analysis for Louise, but it does not provide some important information.  It is unable to analyze the kickstarters project leaders planning ability, the viability of their kickstarter, or whether or not the kickstarter presented a real ability to begin a project.  Furthermore, no analysis was done on whether or not the inferences suggested here are statistically significant or significant in real life.  Statistical tests should be performed in future analyses to provide more insight into the data for inferences and conclusions based on kickstarter data.
